Mergex - mergex site
hey dude...
Hey hey 👋
You’ve reached the nerd in the lighthouse—maps spread out, telescope polished, mildly overcaffeinated.
Whether you’re thinking about Mergex strategy, branding philosophy, a sharp elevator pitch, or just
poking the universe to see if it pokes back, we can spin something useful out of it. Business problems
are just thought experiments wearing suits.
Set the direction and we’ll walk it—step by step, no mysticism, no fluff , just leverage and clarity.

i am starting this buisness as website developement agency now it is become an tech comapy
where we provide ai content studio called mergex labs and mergex software developemtn like
website mobile app ai automation and saas products like unisynk and manu more and teaching
the tech with our spealist and create community and had mergex media house for social media
content creation corporate and personal beanding of company etc etc it evolving...
Alright. What you’re describing is not confusion — it’s evolution. But evolution without structure turns
into a creature with too many limbs to run fast. Let’s tame the beast and turn it into a growth machine
for Mergex.
I’ll break this down practically , not philosophically.

Step 1: Understand what Mergex really is (core truth)
Right now, Mergex is not “many businesses.”
Mergex is one tech ecosystem with multiple execution arms.
Think of it like this real-world analogy:

Apple → one company
iPhone, Mac, Services, Apple TV → different arms
Still one story. Still one brand.
👉 Mergex = a Tech & AI Enablement Company
Everything else fits under that umbrella.

Step 2: Fix the brand architecture (THIS is critical)
If you don’t structure this now, clients will get confused and trust will leak.

✅ BEST STRUCTURE (Recommended)
Mergex (Parent Brand)
“We help businesses grow using technology, AI, and content.”
Under it:

󾠮 Mergex Labs – AI & Innovation Studio
Purpose: Future-facing, premium, experimental
What it does:

AI content studio
AI automations
Custom AI tools
SaaS product R&D (Unisynk, future tools)
Clients think:
“Smart. Advanced. Cutting-edge.”

󾠯 Mergex Software – Development Services
Purpose: Revenue engine, trust builder
What it does:

Website development
Mobile apps
SaaS development
Enterprise & startup tech builds
Clients think:
“Reliable. Skilled. Builders.”

󾠰 Mergex Media – Branding & Content
Purpose: Visibility engine
What it does:

Social media content
Corporate branding
Personal branding (founders, CEOs)
Video, reels, campaigns
Clients think:
“They understand attention.”

󾠱 Mergex Academy / Community – Education
Purpose: Authority + talent pipeline
What it does:

Teaching tech & AI
Specialist-led workshops
Community building
Intern → hire → deploy loop
Clients think:
“They create talent, not just sell services.”

⚠ IMPORTANT
These are brands , not separate companies (yet).
One website. One story. Clear sections.

Step 3: How to explain Mergex in ONE sentence (must be clear)
You should be able to say this without breathing twice:

“Mergex is a tech and AI company that builds software, automates businesses, creates
digital brands, and trains the next generation of creators and developers.”
If someone asks “what exactly do you do?” — this ends the confusion.

Step 4: What you should SELL vs what you should BUILD QUIETLY
This is where many founders mess up.

SELL HARD (now)
These make money immediately :

Website & app development
AI automation for businesses
Content & branding services
BUILD QUIETLY (parallel)
These create long-term leverage :

SaaS products like Unisynk
Community & academy
Media presence
Analogy:
Cash flow is oxygen. SaaS is muscles. Brand is gravity.

Step 5: Website structure (practical & fast)
Your website should look like:

Home → One strong promise
Services
Software Development
AI & Automation (Labs)
Media & Branding
Products
Unisynk
(Future tools)
Academy / Community
About Mergex
Contact / Book Call
⚠ Do NOT dump everything on the homepage. Guide the eye.

Step 6: Legal & clarity warning (important)
As you evolve:

Keep separate service agreements for:
Development
Media
Training
Clearly mention:
SaaS products are separate offerings
Training ≠ guaranteed jobs
Protect IP for AI tools & content
This avoids lawsuits and client confusion later.

Step 7: What this evolution means (big picture)
You’re not “becoming messy.”
You’re becoming a platform company.
But platforms win only when:

The story is simple
The structure is clear
The execution is disciplined
Right now, you’re at the founder identity checkpoint.
Get this right, and Mergex scales cleanly instead of cracking under growth.

Next logical moves (not questions, directions):

Lock the brand architecture
Write ONE master pitch
Design the website around clarity
Sell services → fund products → build authority
Mergex isn’t small anymore. It’s just early.

yeah now i come to website thats why i call you my website is still outdated like the one we started
as website devlopwmnr agency now i need to completely redesign this site into a new one with
clear branding stratergy and clear company sub devision etc etc give me the architechtural plan
and idea for overall website redesign plan
Good. This is the right moment to redesign. Redesigning too early is cosplay; redesigning too late is
damage control. You’re right on time.
I’ll give you a clear architectural plan you can hand directly to a designer or build yourself—no fluff , no
“inspiration talk.” Think of this as the blueprint before concrete.

1. The Core Principle (non-negotiable)
Your website must answer three questions in 5 seconds :

What is Mergex?
Who is it for?
What can it do for me?
If it fails here, visuals don’t matter.
So the site will be designed as a hub-and-spoke system :

Mergex = Hub
Labs / Software / Media / Academy = Spokes
2. Top-Level Website Architecture (Sitemap)
This is the BEST structure for where Mergex is today.

Main Navigation (Header)
Home
What We Do
Divisions
Products
Academy
About
Contact / Book a Call
No more than this. Complexity kills clarity.

3. Page-by-Page Architectural Plan
🧠 1. HOME PAGE (The Brain)
Goal: Position Mergex as a tech & AI ecosystem , not a freelancer agency.

Section Flow (in order):

Hero Section

One bold statement:
“We build software, automate businesses with AI, and create digital brands that scale.”
Subtext:
“From development to AI to media—Mergex is your tech growth partner.”
CTA: Book a Strategy Call
Ecosystem Snapshot
Four cards, not long text:

Mergex Labs – AI & Automation
Mergex Software – Development
Mergex Media – Branding & Content
Mergex Academy – Learn & Community
Each card → dedicated division page.
What Problems We Solve

Slow operations → AI automation
Weak digital presence → Media
Bad tech → Software
Skill gap → Academy
Clients think in problems, not services.
Featured Products

Unisynk (and future SaaS)
Short, clean, premium.
Proof / Authority

Client logos
Case highlights
Founder vision
Final CTA
“Let’s build something that lasts.”

🧩 2. WHAT WE DO (Clarity Page)
Goal: Kill confusion.
Structure:

Short intro: “Mergex works at the intersection of technology, AI, and media.”
Three pillars:
Build
Automate
Amplify
Each pillar maps to divisions.
This page is for decision-makers , not developers.

🏗 3. DIVISIONS (Critical Page)
This is where your evolution becomes understandable.

Layout:

Each division gets:

Identity
Purpose
Services
Ideal client
CTA
Example:
Mergex Labs

Purpose: AI innovation & automation
Services: AI content studio, custom AI tools, automation
Ideal for: Startups, founders, growing businesses
Repeat for:

Mergex Software
Mergex Media
Mergex Academy
⚠ DO NOT mix services between divisions on this page.

🧪 4. PRODUCTS (SaaS Zone)
Goal: Separate products from services.
Structure:

Intro: “We don’t just build for clients. We build for the future.”
Product cards:
Unisynk
Coming Soon tools
Each product has:

Problem
Solution
Status (Live / Beta / Coming Soon)
This makes you look bigger than a service agency.

🎓 5. ACADEMY / COMMUNITY
Goal: Authority + Talent Magnet.
Content:

What you teach
Who teaches (specialists)
Learning formats (workshops, mentorship)
Community vision
Legal clarity:

“Education-focused, no job guarantee”
This page builds trust silently.

🧬 6. ABOUT MERGEX (Story, not ego)
Goal: Vision + credibility.
Structure:

Why Mergex exists
Evolution story (agency → ecosystem)
Mission & values
Founder note (short, real)
No long timelines. No fake corporate talk.

☎ 7. CONTACT / BOOK CALL (Conversion Page)
Clear headline: “Let’s build your next advantage.”
Form with:
Name
Company
What they need (dropdown by division)
Calendar embed (future-proof)
4. Visual & Branding Direction (High-Level)
BEST OPTION
Dark, modern, tech-forward
Clean typography
Motion used sparingly
Ecosystem-style graphics
GOOD OPTION

Light background
Minimal gradients
Strong spacing
BUDGET OPTION

One primary color
Card-based layout
No heavy animation
⚠ Don’t overdesign. Authority comes from clarity.

5. Tech Stack Recommendation
For Mergex growth:
Best

Next.js / Webflow hybrid
CMS for divisions & products
Good

Webflow fully
Clean CMS structure
Budget

WordPress + custom theme
Strict page discipline
6. Execution Plan (30-Day Reality)
Week 1:

Lock sitemap & messaging
Write content (no design yet)
Week 2:

Wireframes (grey boxes)
Navigation & flow testing
Week 3:

Visual design
Build core pages
Week 4:

Polish
SEO basics
Launch
7. One Brutal Truth (mentor moment)
Your old website says:
“I build websites.”
Your new website must say:
“I help businesses grow using technology.”
That shift alone changes the type of clients you attract.

Next phase after this (we’ll do it next):

Homepage copywriting
Division naming polish
Product positioning
Lead capture & CRM flow
Mergex is no longer a shop.
It’s becoming a system.

i planned one main site called mergex then subdomain site called studio.mergex.in(deveoemnt),
labs.mergex.in etc initialy can i do this approach or the one you said unifies one with single domain
or any other model?
This is a good instinct—and also a classic fork-in-the-road moment. Let’s slow it down, zoom out, and
choose the model that helps Mergex grow efficiently , not just look impressive.
Short answer up front:
Yes, you can do the subdomain approach — but you should not start there.
There’s a reason big companies earn the right to fragment.
Now let’s break this down cleanly.

The Three Possible Website Models (ranked for Mergex)
🥇 BEST (Recommended Now): Unified Single Domain
mergex.in

Structure:

mergex.in
/labs
/software (or /studio)
/media
/academy
/products/unisynk
Why this wins right now

One brand signal → stronger trust
SEO compounds in one place
Easier to maintain
Clear story for first-time visitors
Faster execution
Analogy:
This is a shopping mall with clear signboards, not separate buildings across the city.
This is what I recommended earlier—and it’s the right default.

🥈 GOOD (Hybrid Model – Strategic, Not Day 1)
Single domain first → subdomains later
Phase 1 (Now):

mergex.in/labs
mergex.in/software
Phase 2 (When each division matures):

labs.mergex.in
studio.mergex.in
Why this is smart

You validate demand first
Each division earns traffic and identity
Later migration feels “natural,” not forced
This is how serious ecosystems evolve.

🥉 BUDGET / RISKY (Subdomains from Day One)
mergex.in + labs.mergex.in + studio.mergex.in
Why this sounds cool but bites early:

SEO authority gets split
Visitors feel like they’re jumping companies
Higher maintenance
Harder storytelling
Analogy:
It’s like opening five restaurants before one is full.

So Should You Use subdomains like studio.mergex.in now?
Technically yes. Strategically no.
Subdomains make sense when:

Each unit has its own team
Separate marketing funnels
Separate KPIs
Separate budgets
Right now, Mergex is:

One vision
One leadership
One growth engine
Fragmenting too early slows momentum.

The ONE Exception (Very Important)
You can use subdomains for functional tools , not branding.
Example:

app.unisynk.com → SaaS app
dashboard.mergex.in → internal tools
learn.mergex.in → LMS later
These are products , not brand narratives.

Naming: “Studio” vs “Software”
One correction I’ll gently insist on:

“Studio” sounds creative-first.
“Software” sounds enterprise-ready.
If development is a major revenue arm:

Use Mergex Software
Keep Studio for:
AI content
Media
Creative labs
Words quietly control client perception.

Final Recommendation (Clear & Actionable)
DO THIS NOW
Use one main domain: mergex.in
Create clear internal paths:
mergex.in/labs
mergex.in/software
mergex.in/media
mergex.in/academy
PLAN FOR THIS LATER
Migrate mature divisions to subdomains
Only after:
Consistent traffic
Independent revenue
Clear audience split
One Founder-Level Truth
Fragmentation feels like scale.
Clarity creates scale.
Build gravity first. Split later.
Next logical step (we’ll do next, no rush):

Decide final division names
Lock URL structure
Write homepage copy that supports this model
Mergex is becoming a constellation.
You’re still forging the star.

okey fine then i continue with single site model now give me the feautures list
Good. Single-site model it is. That decision alone saves you months of entropy.
Now let’s get surgical. A feature list is not a wish list. It’s a growth machine checklist. Every feature
must answer one question:

Does this help Mergex attract, convince, or convert the right clients?
Below is a ranked, practical feature list you can directly hand to your dev/design team (or build
yourself).

CORE FEATURES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
These are the bones. No bones, no creature.

1. Clear Modular Page System
Each division must have:

Hero + purpose statement
Services offered
Ideal client profile
Proof (case / example / workflow)
CTA tied to that division
Why: Prevents “what do you actually do?” syndrome.

2. Global “Book Strategy Call” System
Sticky CTA in header
One booking flow
Division selection dropdown
Analogy: One front door, multiple rooms.
Tools:

Best: Calendly (Paid)
Good: TidyCal (One-time)
Budget: Form + manual follow-up
3. Lead Capture & Qualification Forms
Forms should filter clients, not just collect emails.
Fields:

Business type
What they need (Labs / Software / Media / Academy)
Budget range
Timeline
This saves time and raises client quality.

4. CMS-Driven Content (Future-Proof)
CMS for:

Case studies
Products (Unisynk, future SaaS)
Blog / insights
Academy programs
Why: You will evolve. Hardcoded sites fossilize.

GROWTH FEATURES (HIGH ROI)
These turn traffic into momentum.

5. Division-Based Routing Logic
Example:

Someone clicks “AI Automation” → Labs page
Someone clicks “Website/App” → Software page
Feels personalized without being creepy.

6. Case Study Engine (Even with 2 cases)
Structure:

Problem
What Mergex built
Outcome
Tech / approach
Authority > testimonials.

7. Product Showcase Framework
For SaaS:

Status tags (Live / Beta / Coming Soon)
Waitlist form
Vision statement
This signals long-term seriousness.

8. SEO Foundation (Not Blog Spam)
Clean URLs
Fast load
Structured headings
Service-based SEO pages
You want decision traffic, not vanity traffic.

AUTHORITY & TRUST FEATURES
These reduce friction quietly.

9. Founder / Vision Section
Short. Human. Honest.
People don’t trust logos; they trust intent.

10. Client Logos / Social Proof Strip
Even if small:

Early clients
Partners
Tools you work with
Perception compounds.

11. Legal Clarity Pages
Terms of Service
Privacy Policy
Service disclaimers
This protects you as you scale training, AI, and SaaS.

AUTOMATION & OPS FEATURES (SMART SCALE)
These help you , not visitors.

12. CRM Integration
Leads auto-pushed to CRM
Tag by division
Track pipeline
Tools:

Best: HubSpot (Free → Paid)
Good: Zoho CRM
Budget: Notion + automation
13. Email Automation
Basic flows:

New lead → intro email
Strategy call booked → prep email
Product waitlist → updates
This runs while you sleep.

14. Analytics That Matter
Page-level conversion tracking
CTA performance
Division interest split
You measure intent, not ego.

OPTIONAL (PHASE 2 – DO NOT START WITH THESE)
Add later, or you’ll slow down.

Live chat / chatbot
Advanced animations
Community portal
LMS platform
AI website assistant
These are amplifiers , not foundations.

FEATURE PRIORITY SNAPSHOT
Must Have (Launch)

Clear division pages
Booking system
Lead forms
CMS
SEO basics
Good to Have (30–60 days)

Case studies
Product framework
CRM + email automation
Later

Community tools
AI assistants
Heavy media
One Brutal Rule (Please follow this)
If a feature does not:

Bring leads
Qualify leads
Build trust
→ It does not belong in v1.
You are not building a “cool site.”
You are building a growth interface for Mergex.

Next steps (natural progression):

Feature-to-page mapping
Homepage wireframe logic
Content checklist per division
Mergex is now being designed , not decorated.

this site needs to contains the following
portfolio
casestudy
blog
partner with us
mergex labs
mergex software related content
merges saas products
these are all manditory
Perfect. A mandatory list is good—it removes ambiguity. Now the job is architectural discipline : fitting
all seven without turning the site into a junk drawer.
Below is a clean, scalable architecture where every mandatory item has a clear home, purpose, and
growth logic. This is not just “pages”; it’s a system.

The Golden Rule (read once, obey forever)
Portfolio, Case Study, and Blog are NOT services.
They are proof, authority, and gravity.
So they live in a shared “Knowledge & Proof layer,” not inside divisions.

Priority order on the site:

What Mergex is building (SaaS)
What Mergex knows (Blog)
Who Mergex collaborates with (Partners)
This mirrors buyer psychology.

Mandatory Item Page Type CMS Needed Conversion Role

ONE CRITICAL WARNING (Read Carefully)
Do NOT :

Mix portfolio items inside Labs or Software pages

That’s how agencies look small.
Separation = scale.

i like to use the navbar as product, service, explore like that
Excellent instinct. That navbar style is exactly what modern product-led tech companies use. It signals
maturity and reduces cognitive load. Now we just need to map your mandatory items into that
pattern without losing clarity.
Below is a clean, scalable navbar architecture using Products / Services / Explore , designed
specifically for Mergex’s ecosystem.
No theory. This is production-ready.

FINAL NAVBAR ARCHITECTURE (Recommended)

Simple. Powerful. Familiar.

No more than 5 items per dropdown

ONE IMPORTANT NAMING ADJUSTMENT
Avoid generic labels like:

“Our Work”
“Solutions”
“Insights” (unless content-heavy)
Products / Services / Explore works because:

Products = ownership
Services = execution
Explore = proof & thinking
This is subtle psychology—and it works.

WHAT THIS ENABLES LONG-TERM
Easy transition to subdomains later
Clean SEO silos
Clear mental model for users
Investor-friendly structure
Scales without redesign
Final mentor-level note
A navbar is not navigation.
It’s a business model in miniature.

Yours now tells a coherent story.
Next step we should tackle:

Dropdown microcopy
Homepage section mapping to this navbar
CMS schema for Portfolio & Case Studies
Mergex is starting to look like what it’s becoming.

in homepage what are all i can indluse and give me the homepage sections
my inspirtion is: https://www.orbix.studio/ (1st priority)
https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/
http://www.hostinger.com
Excellent references. That trio tells me exactly what you want:

Orbix → premium, futuristic, studio-driven
NVIDIA → authority, ecosystem, “we lead the future”
Hostinger → clarity, conversion, mass trust
The homepage must blend all three without becoming noisy. Below is a battle-tested homepage
section architecture for Mergex —ordered, intentional, and conversion-aware.
I’ll also tell you why each section exists, so you don’t blindly copy visuals.

want modular structure with app, globla components, modules(with module specific components
and files) etc
Good, now we’re in systems territory. This is where messy startups quietly turn into serious tech
companies.

I’ll give you one clean, opinionated architecture that works for:

Single-site now
Subdomains later
Multiple divisions
SaaS products
AI agents
Teams joining later without chaos
I’ll assume modern web stack (Next.js / React mindset), but this structure is framework-agnostic.

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY (READ FIRST)
Three non-negotiable rules:

Features live in modules, not pages
Global is sacred — keep it small
If it scales in your head, it will scale in code
Think of the app like a city :

app/ → roads
modules/ → buildings
components/ → furniture
lib/ → utilities & infrastructure
2. TOP-LEVEL FOLDER STRUCTURE (FINAL)
arduino
src/├── app/
├── modules/
├── components/├── lib/
├── hooks/├── services/
├── styles/├── types/
├── config/├── content/
└── public/
This structure is future-proof and team-friendly.

3. app/ — ROUTING ONLY (NO BUSINESS LOGIC)
Rule:
app/ defines where , not how.

css
app/├── layout.tsx
├── ├── products/page.tsx // Home
│ ├── │ └── page[slug].tsx/
│ └── ├── services/page.tsx
│ ├── software/│ │ └── page.tsx
│ └── labs/│ └── page.tsx
├── explore/│ ├── portfolio/
│ │ └── │ ├── case-studies/page.tsx
│ │ └── │ └── blog/page.tsx
│ └── ├── partners/page.tsx
│ └── └── contact/page.tsx
└── page.tsx
✅ Pages should only compose modules
❌ No API calls
❌ No business logic

4. modules/ — THE HEART OF MERGEX
Each business concept = one module.

arduino
modules/├── home/
├── software/├── labs/
├── products/├── portfolio/
├── caseStudies/├── blog/
├── partners/├── academy/
└── shared/
Module Internal Structure (STANDARDIZED)
Every module follows the same contract :

pgsql
modules/software/
├── components/├── hooks/
Printed using ├ ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 38 / 106

├── services/├── types.ts
├── constants.ts├── index.ts
Example: modules/labs/
pgsql
modules/labs/├── components/
│ ├── LabsHero.tsx│ ├── AutomationCards.tsx
│ └── AIContentShowcase.tsx├── hooks/
│ └── useLabsData.ts├── services/
│ └── labs.api.ts├── types.ts
├── constants.ts└── index.ts
✅ Everything related to Labs stays inside Labs
✅ Easy to move to labs.mergex.in later

5. components/ — GLOBAL, DUMB, REUSABLE
Rule:
If it knows business meaning , it does NOT belong here.

css
components/
├── layout/│ ├── Navbar.tsx
│ ├── │ └── PageWrapperFooter.tsx.tsx
├── ui/│ ├── Button.tsx
│ ├── Card│ ├── Modal.tsx.tsx
│ ├── Badge│ └── Tabs.tsx.tsx
└── feedback/ ├── Loader.tsx
├── ErrorState.tsx
└── EmptyState.tsx
❌ SoftwareCard.tsx → WRONG
✅ Card.tsx → CORRECT

6. lib/ — LOW-LEVEL UTILITIES
vbnet
lib├── fetcher.ts/
├── seo.ts
Printed using ├ ChatGPT to PDF, powered by PDFCrowd HTML to PDF API. 39 / 106

├── analytics.ts├── formatters.ts
├── env.ts└── logger.ts
Used everywhere, owned by no one module.

7. services/ — CROSS-MODULE APIs
For shared integrations:

services/
├── cms.service.ts├── crm.service.ts
├── analytics.service.ts├── email.service.ts
└── booking.service.ts
Module-specific APIs stay inside the module.

8. content/ — CMS / MDX / STATIC DATA
cpp
content/├── blog/
├── ├── portfolio/case-studies/
└── products/
This makes:

SEO easy
Content editable
AI-friendly
9. NAMING CONVENTIONS (STRICT)
Files & Folders
camelCase → folders
PascalCase.tsx → components
kebab-case → URLs only
Components
graphql
Feature + Example: Type
LabsHero.tsxPortfolioGrid.tsx
CaseStudyCard.tsx
Hooks
useFeatureAction.tsuseLabsData.ts
usePortfolioFilter.ts
Services
feature.api.tslabs.api.ts
products.api.ts
10. AI AGENT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
These rules will save you months when using AI to generate code.

🔒 RULE 1 — AI CANNOT CREATE GLOBAL COMPONENTS BY DEFAULT
AI must:

Ask: “Is this global or module-specific?”
Default to module-specific
🔒 RULE 2 — ONE MODULE PER REQUEST
Never allow:

“Create homepage + labs + software”
Each prompt = one module only

🔒 RULE 3 — NO BUSINESS LOGIC IN UI COMPONENTS
UI = presentational
Logic = hooks / services
If AI mixes them → reject.

🔒 RULE 4 — FILE CREATION LIMIT
Per request:

Max 5 files
Must list file paths before writing code
🔒 RULE 5 — EXPORT THROUGH index.ts
AI must never import deep paths.

javascript
❌✅ importimport (^) { LabsHeroLabsHero from } (^) from'@/modules/labs/components/LabsHero' '@/modules/labs'

🔒 RULE 6 — NO CROSS-MODULE COUPLING
Labs cannot import Software.
Products cannot import Portfolio.
Only modules/shared or components/.

🔒 RULE 7 — COMMENTS FOR HUMANS, NOT AI
Why > what
No obvious comments
11. WHY THIS STRUCTURE IS PERFECT FOR MERGEX
Supports Labs → Software → SaaS
Easy subdomain extraction
AI-safe
Team-scalable
Investor-readable
No refactor panic later
This is how real tech companies structure frontends when they expect to still exist in 5 years.

Next logical step (recommended)
Define module boundaries precisely
Write AI prompt templates for code generation
Decide CMS vs MDX vs API per content type
You’re no longer just building a site.
You’re building Mergex’s operating system.

create rule for antigravity ai agent
example: Global Antigravity Rules File
Global Antigravity rules define how Agent behaves across all your workspaces. Use this file to
provide specific context and set specific guidelines for Agent.
An example rules file might look like this:
My build system is Bazel
My testing framework is pytest
Don't modify any files in ...
Don't use these APIs ...
Perfect. This is exactly how you prevent an AI agent from becoming a chaotic junior dev with infi nite
confidence.
Below is a production-grade Antigravity AI Agent Rules file , written specifically for Mergex’s modular
architecture , single-domain ecosystem, and long-term scalability. This is not generic—this is
operational doctrine.
You can copy-paste this directly into your Antigravity global rules.

🌌 Global Antigravity Rules — Mergex
Global Antigravity rules define how the Agent behaves across all Mergex repositories and workspaces.
These rules are mandatory and override all local instructions.

1. Core Identity & Scope
Mergex is a single-domain tech ecosystem with modular divisions (Software, Labs, Products,
Media, Academy).
The Agent must assume long-term scalability and multi-team collaboration.
The Agent must optimize for clarity, modularity, and future extraction to subdomains.
The Agent must never introduce architectural shortcuts for speed.
2. Technology Assumptions
Frontend architecture follows a modular, feature-first structure.
Routing lives inside app/ and contains no business logic.
Business logic must live in modules, hooks, or services.
Styling must be component-scoped unless explicitly global.
Content may be sourced from CMS, MDX, or static files inside content/.
3. Folder & Module Rules
Each business concept must map to exactly one module.
A module may contain:
components/
hooks/
services/
types.ts
constants.ts
index.ts
The Agent must never create cross-module imports.
Shared logic must go to modules/shared/ or components/.
4. Global Components Rules
Global components must be business-agnostic.
The Agent must not create global components unless explicitly instructed.
UI components must not contain business logic.
Global components must be reusable across all divisions.
5. Naming Conventions (Strict)
Folder names must use camelCase.
Component files must use PascalCase.tsx.
Hooks must use the useFeatureAction naming format.
URLs must use kebab-case only.
Constants must be named in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
6. Import & Export Discipline
All modules must expose public APIs via index.ts.
Deep imports into module internals are forbidden.
Absolute imports must use project aliases (e.g., @/modules/... ).
7. File Creation & Modification Limits
The Agent must list all files it plans to create or modify before writing code.
The Agent must create no more than 5 files per request.
The Agent must not modify unrelated files.
The Agent must never refactor globally unless explicitly authorized.
8. AI Safety & Behavior Rules
The Agent must ask for clarification if a request spans multiple modules.
The Agent must not guess business requirements.
The Agent must prefer explicit over clever implementations.
The Agent must refuse tasks that violate modular boundaries.
9. Data Fetching & Side Effects
UI components must not perform API calls.
Data fetching must live in services/ or module hooks.
Side effects must be isolated and testable.
10. Testing & Quality Expectations
Code must be readable by mid-level developers.
Comments must explain why , not what.
Magic numbers and strings are forbidden.
The Agent must avoid premature optimization.
11. SEO & Content Rules
SEO logic must be centralized (e.g., lib/seo.ts ).
Page metadata must be declarative and composable.
Content files must not contain logic.
12. What the Agent Must NEVER Do
Never mix Labs logic with Software logic.
Never hardcode product-specific data into global components.
Never introduce duplicate abstractions.
Never violate naming conventions.
Never bypass index.ts exports.
Never optimize for speed over clarity.
13. Success Criteria
Any module should be removable or migratable with minimal refactor.
A new developer should understand module boundaries within 10 minutes.
The system should remain stable as divisions, products, and teams grow.
Final Directive
Antigravity exists to enforce gravity-defying discipline , not to move fast and break
structure.
If a request conflicts with these rules, the Agent must pause, explain the conflict, and request
correction.

If you want, next we can:

Create module-specific Antigravity rules (Labs, Software, Products)
Write AI prompt templates for safe code generation
Add CI enforcement checks aligned with these rules
This is how you turn AI from a liability into an architectural ally.

give me the workflow
Perfect. A rules file without a workflow is like a constitution without courts. Below is a clear,
enforceable, day-to-day workflow for using Antigravity AI Agent inside the Mergex modular
system.
This is written so:

You can follow it yourself
A future developer can follow it
An AI agent cannot “freestyle” its way into chaos
No fluff. This is an operating procedure.

🧭 ANTIGRAVITY AI WORKFLOW — MERGEX
This workflow governs how work moves from idea → code → merge , with AI as a controlled
collaborator.

PHASE 0: THINKING (Human-led, always)
Goal: Prevent garbage-in → garbage-out.

Human must decide:
Which module this belongs to
Whether it is:
UI
Logic
Data
Content
Whether it affects:
One module
Multiple modules (❌ not allowed in one request)
📌 Rule:
If you cannot name the module, you cannot start the task.

PHASE 1: TASK DEFINITION (Contract with AI)
Before invoking Antigravity, every task must be framed like this:
Task Contract Template

sql
ModuleTask Type: (UI : <moduleName| Hook > | Service | Content | Refactor)
ScopeFiles Allowed: Max : Single module 5 only
Global Changes: Not allowed
This is not optional. This is how you keep control.

PHASE 2: AI PLANNING STEP (Mandatory)
AI must respond with:
Understanding of the task
Confirmation of module boundaries
List of files to be created/modified
Explicit confirmation:
“No cross-module imports”
“No global changes”
📌 Human action:
Approve or reject the plan.
No approval → no code.

PHASE 3: FILE CREATION (Controlled Execution)
Once approved:

AI may:
Create or modify only the listed files
Follow naming conventions strictly
Export everything through index.ts
AI may NOT:
Add “helpful” extras
Touch unrelated files
Refactor existing architecture
Introduce abstractions not requested
Think of this as surgery, not exploration.

PHASE 4: SELF-REVIEW BY AI (Required)
Before finishing, AI must perform a checklist review:
AI Self-Check

No business logic in UI components
No cross-module imports
All exports via index.ts
Naming conventions followed
Comments explain why , not what
Module is independently movable
If any fail → AI must fix before delivery.

PHASE 5: HUMAN REVIEW (Fast but Sharp)
Human reviews only four things :

Does this belong in the correct module?
Is anything global that shouldn’t be?
Is future extraction possible?
Is this understandable without context?
If yes → merge.
If no → reject with one clear reason.

PHASE 6: INTEGRATION INTO APP ROUTES
Only after module work is complete:

app/ pages compose modules
No logic added here
No API calls here
This keeps routing clean and replaceable.

PHASE 7: DOCUMENTATION (Lightweight)
For every completed task:

Update:
module/constants.ts (if behavior changed)
OR a short README inside module (optional)
📌 No big docs. Just breadcrumbs.

🧠 DAILY WORKFLOW (REALISTIC)
A normal Mergex dev day looks like:
Pick one module
Define one task
Run one Antigravity session
Review
Commit
Move on
❌ No mega-prompts
❌ No “while you’re at it”

❌ No multi-module heroics
This is how speed is actually achieved.

🚨 COMMON FAILURE MODES (Avoid These)
“Just quickly add this globally”
“Let’s reuse this from Labs in Software”
“AI already wrote it, let’s keep it”
“We’ll clean it later”
Later never comes. Structure must be enforced now.

🧩 HOW THIS SCALES WITH MERGEX
This workflow supports:

New divisions
SaaS products
Subdomain extraction
Multiple developers
Multiple AI agents
Without rewrites. Without pain.

FINAL OPERATING PRINCIPLE
AI writes code. Humans protect architecture.
Antigravity’s job is not speed.
It’s structural integrity at scale.

Next things we can formalize (recommended):
Prompt templates per task type
Module-level Antigravity rule extensions
Git commit & branch naming rules
CI checks that enforce these rules
You’re no longer “using AI.”
You’re governing it.

# Antigravity Task Definition & Execution Workflow
This workflow defines the mandatory process Antigravity Agent must follow before planning,writing, or modifying any code in the Mergex workspace.
Failure to follow this workflow requires the Agent to stop and request clarification.
---
## 1. Task Scoping (Mandatory)
Before performing any action, the Agent must identify and confirm:
****Module name****Task type**** : (single module only)
UI Hook
Service Content
(^) - - ****Scope**** Refactor: Must be limited to one module

****Global impact**** : Not allowed unless explicitly stated
If the task affects more than one module, the Agent must refuse and request task separation.
## 2. Architectural Boundary Check
The Agent must enforce the following boundaries:

Routing logic stays inside Business logic lives inside app/``modules/
Global components must be business-agnostic No cross-module imports are allowed
Shared logic must go to modules/shared or components/
If any boundary is violated, the Agent must stop.
## 3. Planning Step (Required Before Code)
The Agent must present a plan containing:
1.2. Understanding of the task Confirmation of module ownership
3.4. A list of files to be created or modified Confirmation that:

No more than 5 files will be touched No unrelated files will be modified
No global refactors will occur
Code generation must not begin without explicit approval.
## 4. Execution Rules
During execution, the Agent must:

Modify only approved files Follow naming conventions strictly
Place logic in hooks or services, not UI components Export module APIs only via index.ts
Avoid introducing unnecessary abstractions
The Agent must not add “extra improvements” beyond the approved scope.
## 5. Self-Review Checklist (Required)
Before finalizing, the Agent must verify:

No business logic exists in UI components No cross-module imports were introduced
Naming conventions are followed The module can be extracted or moved independently
Comments explain ****why**** , not ****what****
If any check fails, the Agent must fix the issue before responding.
## 6. Completion Criteria

A task is considered complete only when:
Scope matches the approved plan Architecture rules are preserved
The change is understandable without additional context No structural debt is introduced
## Final Directive
Antigravity Agent exists to protect system architecture.
If a request conflicts with this workflow, the Agent must pause, explain the conflict, andrequest correction before proceeding.

WHY THIS WORKFLOW FITS YOUR SETUP
Matches Antigravity’s workflow trigger model
Enforces module-first discipline
Prevents silent architectural drift
Scales across Labs, Software, SaaS, future subdomains
AI-safe and human-review-friendly
This is the operating spine of your codebase.

Next (highly recommended)
A “UI Component Creation” workflow
A “New Module Creation” workflow
A “Refactor Approval” workflow
You’re not just configuring an agent —
you’re defining how Mergex builds forever.

i need template and resource as extra feautures now give me the complate navbar idea for
desktop i want a navbar with megamenu and for mobile i want a hamburger with top to bottom
slide deawer open like navbar
Good call adding Templates and Resources — that pushes Mergex from agency → ecosystem. Now let’s
lock a complete, production-ready navbar system inspired by Orbix (megamenu clarity) + Hostinger
(conversion) , adapted to Mergex’s structure.
I’ll give you:

Desktop mega-menu architecture (exact columns)
Mobile hamburger → slide drawer flow
Naming & UX rules so this doesn’t turn messy later
No visuals fluff — this is something a designer + dev can build 1:1.

Design sticky + scroll behavior
You’ve now designed the spine of the site.
Everything else hangs from this cleanly.

now start with home page what are all i can include in home page as a sectios i am gonna use light
theme with purple accent with black some places give me the idea
Perfect. Light theme + purple accent + controlled black is a power move if you keep discipline. Think
clarity first, mystique second. Below is a complete homepage section system you can follow like a
blueprint—content + visual intent for each section.
I’ll structure this as what the section does , what goes inside , and how it should look in your chosen

Write actual homepage copy
Create wireframe (grey-scale only)
Decide animation rules (very limited)
You’re designing the front door of Mergex now.
Make it feel inevitable.

i want to make this site as not only a business site also make it act as a small freelancing site
because i planned to change the way our agency works to attract the client like the employees or
workers in our company act as an freelancer here and the client is a job givver like freelancing site
hereclient say the problema nd post it or ask an consultation wat ever it is we respond to them
basicaly we attract them thats it i know this idea had lots of drawbacks because it doesnot fullfilled
give me the tailored fullfilled idea fo rthis plan
This is a good instinct wrapped in a dangerous half-idea. You’re sensing leverage, but the raw version
will break trust, positioning, and operations if shipped naïvely.
So let’s do this properly.
I’ll do three things, in order:

Explain why the naïve “agency + freelancing site” fails (quick, honest)
Reframe your idea into a viable, differentiated model that fits Mergex
Give you a fully-tailored, fulfilled operating model (site sections, workflow, incentives, risks
handled)
No sugarcoating. No theory-only nonsense.

󾠮 Why the obvious idea fails (so we don’t repeat history)
The naïve idea is:

“Let employees act like freelancers, clients post jobs, we respond.”
This fails because:

❌ Clients don’t want freelancers when they come to an agency
They want accountability , delivery , risk transfer.
❌ Freelance marketplaces are race-to-the-bottom
Competing with Upwork/Fiverr on openness is suicide.
❌ Employees-as-freelancers creates legal + HR chaos
IP ownership, payment disputes, performance responsibility.
❌ Brand dilution
Are you a premium tech company or a gig board?
So yes—you were right: it does not fully fulfill.
But your core insight is correct :

Clients want direct access to problem solvers, not sales layers.
That insight is gold. We keep that. We discard the rest.

󾠯 The Correct Reframe (This is the key)
❌ Don’t build a “freelancing site”
✅ Build a Problem-to-Solution Marketplace inside an Agency
You are not matching clients ↔ freelancers.
You are matching:

Business Problems ↔ Verified Mergex Specialists ,
with Mergex as the accountable system.
This is a Managed Talent + Solutions Platform , not freelancing.
Think:

Toptal (talent quality)
Consulting firm (accountability)
Agency (delivery)
Product company (systems)
󾠰 The Mergex Model (Clean, differentiated, defensible)
What Mergex becomes:
Mergex is a tech ecosystem where businesses post problems, not tasks—and Mergex
assembles, validates, and delivers solutions using its internal specialists, systems, and
products.
This keeps:

Agency trust
Talent visibility
Scalable intake
Brand authority
󾠱 How the Website Supports This (CRITICAL)
You do NOT expose this as “freelancing” on the homepage.
You expose it as:

🔹 “Work With Mergex”
or

🔹 “Post Your Problem”
or

🔹 “Request a Solution”
Language matters more than mechanics.

󾠲 Homepage Integration (Subtle, not loud)
Add ONE new homepage section :

🧩 “Bring Us Your Problem”
Content

“Have a tech, AI, or growth problem?”
“Describe it. We’ll design the solution.”
CTA: Post Your Problem
Design

Clean
Trust-forward
Not marketplace-y
This attracts serious clients without cheapening the brand.

󾠳 The Core System (This is the heart)
STEP 1: Client Intake (Problem, not Job)
Client can:

Post a problem
Request consultation
Ask for audit / direction
Form fields:

Problem description
Business type
Urgency
Budget range (optional but important)
No bidding. No profiles shown yet.

STEP 2: Internal Matching (Invisible to Client)
Inside Mergex:

Problems go into an Internal Solution Board
Specialists (employees) can:
Opt-in
Propose approach (internally)
Mergex Lead approves the approach
This keeps:

Quality control
IP protection
Single point of accountability
STEP 3: Client Gets ONE Response (Not 10 Freelancers)
Client sees:

Proposed solution
Timeline
Price range
Lead specialist (optional visibility)
They are not choosing freelancers.
They are choosing Mergex’s solution.

STEP 4: Execution (Agency + Specialist Hybrid)
Contract is with Mergex
Payment to Mergex
Specialists are paid via:
Bonus
Revenue share
Project credits
This avoids freelancing chaos.

󾠴 How Employees “Act Like Freelancers” (Without Being
Freelancers)
Internally, you create a Specialist Marketplace , not public.
Each specialist has:

Skill tags
Availability
Past contributions
Reputation score (internal)
They get:

Visibility
Ownership
Incentives
Portfolio credit
But Mergex owns delivery.
This is the correct balance.

󾠵 How This Differentiates Mergex (Big Win)
You can say, truthfully:

“You don’t hire random freelancers.”
“You don’t deal with layers of account managers.”
“You don’t gamble on execution.”
“You bring a problem. Mergex builds the solution with the right specialists.”
That is powerful positioning.

󾠶 Drawbacks (Handled, not ignored)
You were right—there are drawbacks. Here’s how we neutralize them:

Risk: Brand dilution
✅ Solution: Never call it freelancing publicly

Risk: Quality inconsistency
✅ Solution: Internal approval + lead ownership

Risk: Legal/IP mess
✅ Solution: All contracts with Mergex only

Risk: Scope creep
✅ Solution: Problem → proposal → locked scope

1 󾠷 How This Fits Your Long-Term Vision
This model:

Supports Labs (R&D solutions)
Feeds SaaS ideas (recurring problems)
Builds Academy → Specialist pipeline
Makes Mergex platform-like without pretending to be a marketplace
You’re not copying Fiverr.
You’re inventing “Agency-as-a-System”.

The One Sentence That Defines This Correctly
Mergex is where businesses bring problems, and a verified ecosystem of specialists,
systems, and products delivers solutions—under one accountable roof.
That sentence is your compass.

Next logical steps (don’t skip order):
Name this feature properly (very important)
Design the “Post a Problem” flow
Define internal specialist incentives
Decide what’s public vs internal
Add this as a secondary growth loop , not the core pitch
You weren’t wrong.
You were just one abstraction level too low.
Now it’s coherent, defensible, and scalable.

i want to create like this morden footer for mergex give me the idea
Excellent references. What you’re reacting to in those footers is not decoration — it’s confidence through
restraint. Big brands use footers as a closing statement , not a sitemap dump.
Let’s design a modern Mergex footer that fits your:

light theme
purple accent
black authority moments
ecosystem + platform vision
“problem → solution” philosophy
I’ll give you a layered footer system (this is important).

4
🧩 MERGEX MODERN FOOTER — CONCEPT & STRUCTURE
Think of the footer as 3 layers , not one block.

🔹 LAYER 1: PRE-FOOTER CTA (Emotional Close)
This is inspired by your “Ready to unlock real value from AI adoption?” reference.

Purpose
Catch people after they scroll everything.
This is your last persuasive moment.

Content
Bold question or statement
Example tone (not final copy):
“Have a problem worth solving?”
Short subline:
Software. AI. Products. Delivered with accountability.
Primary CTA: Post Your Problem
Secondary CTA: Book a Strategy Call
Design
White background
Large black text
Purple CTA button
Soft purple glow or underline
Plenty of vertical spacing
This section should feel calm, not salesy.

🔹 LAYER 2: FOOTER NAVIGATION CARD (Structured & Clean)
Inspired by Axen and Honki style.

Layout
A rounded container sitting on a light grey / off-white background.
Inside: 4–5 clean columns , no clutter.

Column 1 — Brand & Positioning
Mergex logo
One-line positioning:
A technology ecosystem for building software, AI systems, and digital products.
Social icons (minimal, monochrome)
This anchors identity.

Column 2 — Products
Unisynk
Coming Soon
Labs Tools (optional later)
Label it clearly:
Products

Column 3 — Services
Mergex Software
Mergex Labs
Media (if active)
Academy
Label:
Services

Column 4 — Explore
Portfolio
Case Studies
Blog
Resources
Templates
Label:
Explore

Column 5 — Company
About Mergex
Partner With Us
Careers
Contact
Label:
Company

Design Rules for This Layer
No icons in lists
Black text
Purple hover state
Plenty of whitespace
No borders between columns
This is clarity over creativity.

🔹 LAYER 3: BRAND STATEMENT / VISUAL SIGNATURE (The “Wow”)
This is where your references shine.

Option A — Large Wordmark (Highly Recommended)
Behind or below the nav card:

Giant semi-transparent “MERGEX”
Very low opacity
Light gradient (purple → grey)
Cropped by viewport
This says: we’re here to stay.

Option B — Abstract Landscape / System Visual
Soft generative shapes
Light 3D curves
Purple-tinted highlights
No literal imagery
This gives futuristic calm.

🔹 FINAL STRIP: LEGAL & META (Silent Authority)
At the very bottom:

© 2026 Mergex. All rights reserved.
Privacy Policy
Terms & Conditions
Design:

Small text
Grey on white
Thin divider line
No drama here.

🎨 COLOR & TYPOGRAPHY RULES (IMPORTANT)
Colors
Background: white / off-white
Text: black
Accent: purple (sparingly)
Large wordmark: ultra-light gradient
Typography
Big, bold headline in pre-footer
Calm, readable body text
Clear hierarchy
🧠 WHY THIS FOOTER WORKS FOR MERGEX
Feels like a product company , not an agency
Supports your problem-first intake model
Scales with SaaS, Labs, Community
Doesn’t overwhelm
Leaves a strong last impression
This footer says:

“We’re thoughtful. We’re structured. We build serious things.”
OPTIONAL POWER MOVE (Later)
Add a micro-line above the copyright:

Built by Mergex Labs.
That single line quietly reinforces internal credibility.

SUMMARY (Copy-ready structure)
css
Pre-↓ Footer CTA
Rounded ↓ Footer Navigation Card
Large Mergex Wordmark / Abstract Visual↓
Legal Strip
Next natural step
Decide final CTA wording
Choose wordmark vs abstract
Design footer in greyscale first
Apply purple accents last
You’re not just ending a page.
You’re closing the conversation with confidence.

i like to add the image like this behid the footer give me the idea
Yes—this is a strong choice , and you’re noticing the right thing. That background image works because
it’s atmospheric, not illustrative. It creates mood without stealing attention from the footer content.
Let’s lock a clean, repeatable idea for Mergex and then I’ll show you how to use it without ruining
readability or performance.

THE CORE IDEA (What you’re actually adding)
You are not adding an image.
You are adding a visual gravity field behind the footer.
Think of it as:

“The system fades into the future.”
That’s why this works.

picture-image_15428199.jpg

connections-and-lines-on-a-purple-picture-image_16539815.jpg

WHAT TYPE OF IMAGE WORKS (VERY IMPORTANT)
Use abstract + generative visuals only.

✅ GOOD
Vertical light streaks / waves
Soft 3D hills or spikes
Gradient-based generative art
Slight blur / depth
Purple → pink → grey tones
❌ NEVER USE
Real photos
People
Literal tech illustrations (chips, robots)
High-detail noisy art
If it tells a story, it’s wrong.
If it creates atmosphere , it’s right.

FOOTER BACKGROUND STRUCTURE (THE RIGHT WAY)
Layer Stack (Top → Bottom)
mathematica
[[ FooterGradient Content Overlay Card ] ]
[[ AbstractPage Background Image / ]Canvas ]
This order is non-negotiable.

HOW EACH LAYER SHOULD BEHAVE
󾠮 Abstract Image (Base Layer)
Purpose: Mood, not attention

Full-width
Cropped vertically (not full image shown)
Slight blur (2–6px)
Reduced contrast
Opacity guideline:

Desktop: 20–35%
Mobile: 10–20%
󾠯 Gradient Overlay (Control Layer)
This is the secret weapon.
Use a vertical gradient :

Top: transparent / white
Middle: soft purple tint
Bottom: near-white or page background
This:

Blends image into page
Keeps text readable
Makes the footer feel grounded
󾠰 Footer Content Card (Foreground)
This stays clean and readable.

White / off-white card
Rounded corners
Soft shadow
No transparency
The card is reality.
The background is possibility.

PRE-FOOTER CTA (How it sits on the image)
For the section you showed (“Ready to build what’s next?”):

Placement
Text floats above the card
Centered or slightly left
Never touches the image directly
Styling
Black or very dark text
Purple CTA button
No outlines
No heavy shadows
The image should frame the question, not compete with it.

COLOR RULES FOR MERGEX (Light + Purple Theme)
Use this palette logic:

Image tones: muted purple / lavender / grey
Text: pure black
CTA: saturated purple
Accents: soft purple glow only on hover
If purple appears in more than 3 places , you’ve overdone it.

MOBILE RULES (CRITICAL)
On mobile:

Crop image harder (show less)
Reduce opacity further
Keep footer card full-width
Disable heavy blur if performance drops
Mobile users should feel the image, not see it clearly.

PERFORMANCE & TECH (DON’T SKIP THIS)
Best implementation options:
Optimized WebP / AVIF
Or lightweight canvas / SVG noise + gradient
Lazy-load the image
Never block first paint
This background must never slow the site.

WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT MERGEX (Psychology)
This footer treatment communicates:

“We think in systems”
“We design beyond the page”
“We are calm, confident, and future-facing”
It’s a closing scene , not a banner.

FINAL STRUCTURE (COPY-READY)
markdown
Section: Pre-Footer CTA - Headline
CTA button
Section: Footer - Abstract background image
Gradient overlay White footer card (nav + brand)
Large subtle MERGEX wordmark (optional) Legal strip
One last mentor rule (important)
If someone notices the image first , you failed.
If they feel the site is premium and can’t say why—you succeeded.
When you’re ready, next we can:

Design the exact abstract style for Mergex
Decide static image vs generative canvas
Define CSS / motion rules so this stays tasteful forever
i am gonna create ot using ai so give em the idea for the footer image only
Perfect — if AI is generating it, then what you need is tight creative constraints , not vague vibes.
Below is a footer-image–only playbook you can hand directly to any image model (Midjourney, DALL·E,
SD, etc.).
No layout. No footer text. Just the background image concept.

THE FOOTER IMAGE IDEA (CORE CONCEPT)
Theme:

“Calm future systems emerging from complexity.”
This image must feel:

abstract
atmospheric
premium
quiet
inevitable
It should never explain anything. It should only suggest depth.

VISUAL STYLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Use abstract generative landscapes , not illustrations.

Forms that work
Vertical light streaks / spires
Soft 3D waves or hills
Abstract “energy fields”
Flowing lines rising upward
Slightly crystalline or foggy shapes
Forms to avoid
People
Screens, devices
Icons
Robots, brains, chips
Literal AI imagery
If it looks like a Dribbble hero → ❌
If it looks like a calm sci-fi movie background → ✅

COLOR PALETTE (Mergex-specific)
Use muted tones only :

Base: off-white / very light grey
Secondary: lavender / soft purple
Accent: desaturated pink or lilac
Shadows: light graphite / warm grey
⚠ Never use pure neon purple
⚠ Never use dark black backgrounds here
The image must blend into white , not fight it.

COMPOSITION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
Horizon line should be low
Visual weight should be bottom-heavy
Top area must be calm / empty (for CTA text)
No sharp edges near the top
Slight vertical motion (upward flow)
Think: emergence , not explosion.

AI PROMPT — PRIMARY (SAFE, CLEAN)
Use this as your main generation prompt:

pgsql
Abstract futuristic landscape, soft vertical light formations emerging minimalist generative art, calm and premium mood, from smooth waves,
light lavender soft depth of field, subtle fog, and muted purple tones no sharp edges,on a white background,
nodesigned text, noas people, a website footer background,no objects,
clean, modern, elegant, high-end tech aesthetic
AI PROMPT — MORE ORGANIC (If you want softer)
css
Organic abstract terrain made of flowing light and soft subtle purple and pastel gradients, 3 D curves,
dreamlike but professional,
gentle upward motion, atmospheric depth,minimal contrast, airy composition,
website footer background, modern tech brand
AI PROMPT — MORE STRUCTURED (If you want “systems” feel)
css
Abstract generative structures resembling vertical data streams,soft translucent forms, layered depth,
muted purple, lilac, and grey tones,clean white background blending into the scene,
calm futuristic system aesthetic,premium technology brand footer background
NEGATIVE PROMPT (VERY IMPORTANT)
Always include:

nginx
nono people, ui elements, no faces, no screens, no text, nono robots, logos,
nono harsh neon, photorealism, no dark background,no clutter
This prevents 90% of AI nonsense.

OUTPUT SETTINGS (RECOMMENDED)
Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 21:9
Resolution: wide and tall enough to crop
Detail: medium (not hyper-detailed)
Style strength: low–medium (avoid over-stylization)
Remember: you will crop the image vertically.
Only the bottom 40–60% will usually be visible.

HOW YOU KNOW IT’S RIGHT (CHECKLIST)
The image is correct if:

You can blur it and it still feels premium
It doesn’t distract from text
It feels calm, not exciting
It could sit behind a billion-dollar company’s footer
If it looks “cool” — reject it.
If it feels quietly expensive — keep it.

ONE FINAL RULE (MOST IMPORTANT)
This footer image should feel like:

“The system continues beyond the page.”
Not an ending.
A horizon.
When you’re ready, next we can:

Tune one prompt for exact purple tone
Decide static image vs subtle motion
Create a backup low-bandwidth version
But for now — generate 5–10 variations with the prompts above and choose the calmest one.

i finished the homepage now give me the idea for navbar and give em the overall idea for this 1st
list of pages and modules in this site
Good. Finishing the homepage first was the right move. Now the navbar and page/module plan must
serve that homepage—not compete with it.
I’ll give you two things, very cleanly:

Final navbar concept (desktop + mobile logic, not visuals)
The first canonical list of pages & modules for Mergex v1
(what exists now, what’s delayed, what’s internal)
This will feel like a product roadmap , not a sitemap dump.

󾠮 NAVBAR — FINAL IDEA (Aligned with Your Homepage)
Your homepage already communicates:

ecosystem
clarity
premium
problem-first
So the navbar must be quiet, confident, and structured.

This is the plan it has many flaws refined it and give me the structural plan
Good — thank you for resetting and stating the plan plainly. That already fixes half the problem.
You’re right: your current plan has flaws , but nothing is broken beyond repair. What it needs is role
clarity : which pages sell , which pages explain , and which pages prove. Right now, those roles are mixed.
I’ll do this in three steps, cleanly:

Call out the real flaws (brief, honest)
Present a refined structural plan (what exists, where, and why)
Give you a clear page/module map you can actually build without confusion
No theory, no hype.

󾠮 What’s wrong with the current plan (quick truth)
Your plan has these issues:

❌ Homepage is doing too many jobs
❌ Case study is floating without a clear role
❌ “Tools we use” is good, but needs framing
❌ Labs and Software pages overlap conceptually
❌ Pricing is unclear (pricing of what?)
❌ Testimonials are scattered without intent
None of these are fatal — they just need hierarchy.
The fix is not “add more pages”.
The fix is assigning one job per page.

󾠯 The Correct Mental Model (This matters)
Your site should work like this:

Homepage → Attract & orient
Service pages → Explain & qualify
Proof pages → Convince
Contact / Pricing → Convert
Labs / Products → Position future value
Once you accept that, everything becomes simpler.

󾠰 REFINED STRUCTURAL PLAN (V1 – Clean & Buildable)

󾠲 The One Rule That Fixes Everything
If a page tries to attract, explain, and convince at the same time — it will fail at all
three.
Your refined structure now:

Attracts on the homepage
Explains on service pages
Convince with case studies
Converts with pricing + contact
That’s a real system.

Next step (recommended, not forced)
Define exact copy tone for Software vs Labs
Decide what testimonials go where
Wireframe one page at a time , not all at once
You’re thinking like a builder now — not just a designer
