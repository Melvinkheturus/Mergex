# Sanity CMS Content Model Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the content models in the Mergex Sanity Studio and how to use them effectively.

## Content Philosophy

> **Sanity manages *what you say*, not *how the site looks*.**

- Layouts and navigation remain code-controlled for design consistency
- Content fills predefined, well-designed templates
- Editors write content, not design pages
