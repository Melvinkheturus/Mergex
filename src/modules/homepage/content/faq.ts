    questions: [
        {
            question: "What kind of company is Mergex?",
            answer: "Mergex is a technology partner built to eliminate fragmentation. Instead of managing multiple vendors for development, AI, content, and automation, you work with one unified system. We're designed for teams that want speed, clarity, and smart execution without the coordination overhead."
        },
        {
            question: "What's the difference between Labs and Systems?",
            answer: "Labs is our creative intelligence division — focused on AI-powered content, visuals, and brand assets. It's where ideas become creative output fast. Systems is our execution and scale division — building software, automating processes, and creating digital infrastructure. Think of Labs as creative firepower, Systems as operational backbone."
        },
        {
            question: "Who is Mergex best suited for?",
            answer: "We work best with founders, product teams, and businesses who need to move fast without building fragmented systems. If you're tired of coordinating between agencies, waiting on timelines, or dealing with tools that don't talk to each other, Mergex exists to solve that."
        },
        {
            question: "Why work with one partner instead of hiring specialists?",
            answer: "Multiple vendors create coordination tax — misaligned timelines, duplicated work, communication overhead, and siloed data. We eliminate that by owning the full picture. One roadmap. One accountability chain. Faster results."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you only work with startups, or do you work with established businesses too?",
            answer: "We work with both. Startups come to us for speed and system-building. Established businesses come to us to eliminate vendor fragmentation, modernize operations, or add AI capabilities without hiring internally. If you're solving a problem with technology, content, or automation, we can help."
        },
        {
            question: "Where should I start if I'm exploring Mergex?",
            answer: "If you need creative output or AI-generated content, explore Labs. If you need software, automation, or systems that scale, start with Systems. Not sure? Book a quick call — we'll help you understand which path makes sense based on your actual problem."

    questions: [
        {
            question: "How does pricing work?",
            answer: "Pricing depends on scope, speed, and level of involvement required. After an initial discussion, we suggest an engagement model that balances efficiency and outcomes — so you're investing in progress, not overhead. We're transparent about costs upfront and structure pricing to align with your goals."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does an MVP actually take?",
            answer: "Most MVPs and early-stage systems are built and launched within 2-4 weeks — not months. We focus on building what matters first, validating early, and iterating fast so your business can move forward without waiting. Complex systems may take longer, but we deliver in phases, not all-or-nothing timelines."
        },
        {
            question: "How involved do we need to be in the process?",
            answer: "We adapt to your level of involvement. Some teams want weekly check-ins and full collaboration. Others prefer to define the goal and let us execute. Either way, we keep you informed, share progress regularly, and make sure you're never surprised by what we deliver."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you work with our existing systems and tools?",
            answer: "Yes. We integrate with your current tech stack, whether that's CRMs, marketing platforms, databases, or internal tools. We don't force a rebuild unless it's necessary. Our job is to extend and improve what you already have, not replace it for the sake of it."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens after launch?",
            answer: "Launch is the beginning, not the end. We optimize, refine, and grow based on real feedback. Depending on the engagement model, we can stay on as ongoing partners for maintenance, iteration, and scaling — or hand off cleanly with full documentation if you prefer to own it internally."
        },
        {
            question: "What if we need changes or pivots mid-project?",
            answer: "We expect that. Requirements evolve as you learn. We build flexibility into our process so changes don't derail momentum. If a pivot makes sense, we adjust. If it doesn't, we'll tell you honestly and explain why staying the course is smarter."
        },
        {
            question: "What does the first conversation look like?",
            answer: "The first conversation is about clarity. We'll listen, ask questions, and help you understand what kind of solution makes sense. If we're a good fit, we'll outline next steps. If not, we'll tell you honestly and point you in the right direction."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you handle both technical development and creative work?",
            answer: "Yes. Our work spans software development, AI automation, generative AI content, design, and digital execution. Because these capabilities live within the same system, execution stays consistent and aligned with your business goals — no handoff friction between 'the dev team' and 'the creative team.'"
