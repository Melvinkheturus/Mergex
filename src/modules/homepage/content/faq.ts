    questions: [
        {
            question: "What exactly does Mergex do?",
            answer: "Mergex works as a technology and growth solution partner. Instead of hiring separate agencies for websites, applications, AI, automation, content, or marketing, teams work with us as a single, accountable partner. We design and deliver the right mix of solutions based on what your business actually needs to grow."
        },
        {
            question: "Who is Mergex best suited for?",
            answer: "We work best with founders and teams who want to move fast without building fragmented systems. If you're growing a business and need technology, AI, content, and digital execution to work together — not in silos — Mergex is designed for that."
        },
        {
            question: "Why not just hire different agencies for different needs?",
            answer: "Managing multiple agencies often leads to misalignment, delays, and duplicated effort. We remove that complexity by owning the full solution — from strategy and design to development, AI automation, content, and digital growth. One partner, one direction, clear outcomes."
        },
        {
            question: "How fast can you actually build and deliver?",
            answer: "Speed is one of our strengths. Most MVPs and early-stage systems are built and launched within weeks — not months. We focus on building what matters first, validating early, and iterating fast so your business can move forward without waiting."
        },
        {
            question: "Can you handle both technical and creative needs?",
            answer: "Yes. Our work spans software, AI automation, generative AI content, video editing, design, and digital marketing. Because these capabilities live within the same system, execution stays consistent and aligned with your business goals."
        },
        {
            question: "What does working with Mergex look like in practice?",
            answer: "We start by understanding your business problem, not by selling a predefined service. From there, we design a solution roadmap and move into fast execution with clear milestones. You work with one team that understands the full picture."
        },
        {
            question: "How do pricing and engagement usually work?",
            answer: "Pricing depends on the scope, speed, and level of involvement required. After an initial discussion, we suggest an engagement model that balances efficiency and outcomes — so you're investing in progress, not overhead."
        },
        {
            question: "What happens in the first conversation?",
            answer: "The first conversation is about clarity. We'll listen, ask questions, and help you understand what kind of solution makes sense. If we're a good fit, we'll outline next steps. If not, we'll tell you honestly."
        }
    ]
